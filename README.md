## Context
AB tests can be used to make data-driven decisions by comparing two versions of something, like a web page or email, to determine which performs better, ultimately improving conversion rates, user experience, and profitability. That said, I am using data available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata) to simulate some AB tests following a statistically rigorous process. 

My goal here is to find the most important variables that can positively and negatively impact the pricing and valuation of Airbnbs through AB tests using the data avaliable and doing some feature engineering
